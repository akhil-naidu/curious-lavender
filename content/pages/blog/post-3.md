It can be broadly divided into some topics like current events, general awareness of India and the world, awards and honors, sports and international organization. All these sections should be updated regularly with current changes.

General awareness of India and the World includes geographical, political, historical, religious, social, economical and cultural aspects of information regarding India and abroad.
